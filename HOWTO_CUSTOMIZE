                        CUSTOMIZE extcarve

What is Magic Signature?
------------------------
Magic signature is used to identity file types.For example,a PDF a file often
begin with header "%PDF" and ends with trailer "%%EOF".Most file has such
magic signature,they are unique.That's no two file type can have same magic
signature.

For more,type "man file" and "man magic".

How extcarve works?
-------------------
extcarve scans the unused blocks of a  harddisk for header and trailer. If
finds a match, It save them.Simple :D 

Code :
-----
To add more file type to extcarve,first you need find appropriate header and
trailer/footer values.Best sources would be hexdump,man magic,wiki,google.

As you may have noticed,extcarve has just a single file named "extcarve.c".You
might be interested in two functions namely extcarve_search4header() and
extcarve_search4footer().By now you must have guessed what these function will
do.Right? extcarve_search4header - Will search for all headers listed here.
extcarve_search4footer- Will search for corresponding footer/trailer entries.

Code snippet from extcarve_search4header()-

  //pdf 
  if ((buf[0] == 0x25 && buf[1] == 0x50 && buf[2] == 0x44 && buf[3] == 0x46
       && buf[4] == 0x2D ))
    {
      //printf ("pdf header found!!!");
      if (needle->header_found != 1)
	{
	  needle->header_found = 1;
	  needle->header_blk = blk;
	  strcpy (needle->dotpart, ".pdf");
	  return 1;
	}
      needle->header_found = -1;
      return -1;
    }

I have pasted the pdf header part above.As you can see above,the if statement
compares hexadecimal value of  "%PDF" (25 50 44 46 2d) against  bytes in buffer
buf.One header is found,header_found flag is set and "blk" number is recored in
"header_blk" field and dotpart (extention) is stored.

And below is the corresponding footer part from extcarve_search4footer():
It search for hexdecimal value %%EOF (25 25 45 4f) against the buf.
One footer is found,footer_found flag is set and "blk" number is recored in 
"footer_blk" field.

      //pdf 
      if (buf[i] == 0x25 && buf[i + 1] == 0x25 && buf[i + 2] == 0x45
	  && buf[i + 3] == 0x4F && buf[i + 4] == 0x46 )
	{
	  if (strcmp (needle->dotpart, ".pdf") == 0)
	    {
	      needle->footer_blk = blk;
	      needle->footer_found = 1;
	      return 1;
	    }
	  else
	    return -1;
	}


Thus If you want to customize extcarve,then add corresponding header code snippet
at the extcarve_search4header and footer at extcarve_search4footer.
For convinence,both these functions has a place holder like 
    //Please add new file type header here
    //Please add new file type footer here
