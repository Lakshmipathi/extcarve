Introduction
=============
extcarve  is designed to recover non-fragmented deleted files  on linux systems that 
are using the ext2,ext3,ext4 filesystem.


****NOTE****
===========
DON'T perform installation on the partition where files are deleted,since new any file creation may overwrite deleted file content.
So install extcarve on a other external drive or pen drive or machine but not the affected partition.

Dependencies
=============
The binary installation of extcarve doesn't have any dependency.

The source installation of extcarve (on unaffected machine) has few dependencies. They are :
	pkg-config
	e2fslibs-dev
	
	Using Ubuntu these can be installed by running the command
		sudo apt-get install  e2fslibs-dev pkg-config

	Using Fedora this can be installed by running the command
		sudo yum install pkgconfig e2fsprogs-devel e2fsprogs-libs

Installation general

Installation of extcarve will need root privileges. You should follow these
steps for both binary and source installation.

Download the tar file into your home directory
	wget http://www.giis.co.in/giis/<extcarve>_<version>.tar

Extract the tar file into your home directory, which will create  a new 
directory called extcarve
