extcarve usage:
==============
Once you have succuessfully installed extcarve from either the binary or source code on separate partition or external drive, now you can use 
this to recover files from deleted drive/partition.


Setup-1:
--------
For example,I have deleted important files from my root partition (sda1).
In order to recover them,I have installed extcarve on a pendrive and mounted it at /Pendrive.
To store any recovered files from extcarve output, I have mounted another (external hdd) on /extcarve

# df
Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1            146221624 123091120  15702820  89% /               <---------Affected partition,where files are deleted.
/dev/sdc1            117218240  79060700  38157540  68% /extcarve       <---------This will be used to save any recovered files.
/dev/sdb1              3865772   2914640    754760  80% /Pendrive       <---------This contains extcarve executable.

Why this setup?
Simply we don't want extcarve to messup with original affected partition.If it recognizes some files ,it can recover them otherwise those files
will remain on /dev/sda1 unrecovered ,gives chance to recover them using other useful :D recovery tools.
Thus running extcarve doesn't affect original drive,regardless of the extcarve recover files or not.

extcarve stores the recovered files at another drive /extcarve.(Though here its external HDD,It can be pen drive too).

Run method-1:
------------
Now lets start running,tool  - 
# cd /Pendrive
# ./extcarve -g
This will prompt you for two inputs - (source and destination)
-----------
Please enter the device name:/dev/sda1

Please enter the output directory - (You must provide separate partition/drive's directory) :/extcarve
-----------
that's it,check out the output directory /extcarve for any recovered files.


Run method-2:
------------
There is another way to run this tool - 
# cd /Pendrive
# ./extcarve -i
This will prompt you for three inputs - (source and destination and No.of blocks)
-----------
Please enter the device name:/dev/sda1

Please enter the output directory - (You must provide separate partition/drive's directory) :/extcarve

Please enter increased block limit:(default is 12) :
-----------
First two inputs are same as the used for "-g" option.Third one is new.Needs some explaination-default block limit 12 refers to how many consecutive blocks, you want to search for a file?For example , In order to recover,a png file, extcarve searches for png header and footer. Lets assume ,extcarve finds png header at unused block (say 10000) , then it will search for footer on next 12 blocks (10000,10001..10012) If it finds them - then those blocks are recovered and save as new file.If it doesn't a footer in 12 blocks. extcarve won't recover the file,since it doesn't find the footer.With default 12 blocks,(If your block size is 4KB),then extcarve will search for file size upto 48KB.

In order to increase this 12 blocks limit ,you use "-i" option.Say you want to recover an important files upto 1MB size,then increase it as -
--------
Please enter increased block limit:(default is 12) :256
--------
Now as with previous example,png footer will be searched upto block 10256.(256*4KB=1024KB=1MB)

Running extcarve --help will give you more details.
